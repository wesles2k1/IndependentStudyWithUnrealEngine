# IndependentStudyWithUnrealEngine
This is a repository to hold an Unreal Engine project with the purpose of developing C++ skills within Unreal Engine, as well as to use them to learn more about design patterns.

This project will be divided into three portions: first, to get acquainted with the usage of C++ within Unreal Engine, then to learn more about design patterns that may be useful in game design with C++, and lastly,
  to combine the first two portions together to implement design patterns into an Unreal Engine project with C++.

Progress:
